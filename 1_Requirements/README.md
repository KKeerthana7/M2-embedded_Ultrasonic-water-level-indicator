# INTRODUCTION
   My project is Ultrasonic Water Level Indicator.
It is an amazing and useful project. This project is to notify the user the amount of water that is prsent in the overhead watertank.      
This project can be further enhanced to control the water level in the tank by turning it on, when thewater level is low, and turning it off when the water level is high. Thus, the arduino water level indicator helps in preventing wastage of water in overhead tank.A transmitter circuit and a receiver circuit. The transmitter circuit makes use of anultrasonic sensor to measure the water level in terms of distance. 
# RESEARCH
   The main objective of the project is to indicate the water level in a water tank. It simply turns on the BUZZER when water falls below a certain level or when water rises over a certain level or when water overflows. It also displays us the current volume of water present in the water tank. I have used an ARDUINO UNO (ATMEGA 328P) to detect the level of water by using an ULTRASONIC SENSOR (HC-SRO4) mounted at the top of the water tank.
   
This is a Ultrasonic sensor based tank water level indicator using an arduino nano. It's a contactless method to meaure the water level. There are other water-level indicator methods available in the market which use wire conductors to measure the level, but those methods may start electrolysis reaction overtime with water and may harm the water quality. So, it is better to use a contactless system and get the accurate results.
# 4W and 1H:
# Where: 
* Can be used in homes,factories,apartments,commercial complexess. 

# What : 
* The water level indicator is a system which gets the information about the water level in reservoirs or in tanks which is used in homes,factories etc.,

# Who: 
* It is an automated detector so there will be no need of manual involvement.

# Why: 
* The purpose of a water level indicator is to gauge and manage the water levels in a water tank. 
# How:
* Water level indicators work by using sensor probes to indicate water levels in a storage tank.
# SWOT ANALYSIS:
# Strength:
* Easy installation,minimal maintenance and automatically adjusts water levels.
# Weakness:
* Electronics are usually built separately.
# Opportunity:
* The control panel can also be programmed to automatically turn on a water pump once levels get too low and refill the water back to the adequate level.
# Threats:
* The rust,foul and deteriorate.
# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
